Ended: July 31, 2020

Current issues preventing closing:

~~~~* Short $515.97 in Fringes:~~ 
~~Fringe benefits for July 2020 are incorrect. They need to be re-calculated so that fringe is also applied to various leave types.~~
~~* Short $6.04 in IDC: Trickle down effect of fringes being incorrect~~~~

~~Once these issues are resolved the total spend for July 2020 should be $37,535.74 AND the LTD total will be at $212,098.66 (which matches our records)~~

ORNL issues have been largely resolved. PAAs are in progress to move July 2020 expenses over to the new worktag.


## GR007979 // NHAP MS/ AL

Ended: September 30, 2020

Current issues preventing closing:

### July
~~* Charges mis-categorized due to missing Object Class:
	* $592.50 (Victoria Burton - Salary) not listed under SC0193 Extra Help
	* $34.60 (Victoria Burton - Fringe) not listed under SC0423 Fringe Rate Expense
	* $307.28 (Victoria Burton - IDC) not calculated because S+F have no Object Class~~

### August
~~* Charges mis-categorized due to missing Object Class:
	* $4,291.67 (Vance Green - Salary) not listed under SC0192 Regular Salaries because S+F have no Object Class
	* $52.50 (Victoria Burton - Extra Help Wages) not listed under SC0193 Extra Help because S+F have no Object Class
	* $1,138.58 (Vance Green - Fringe) not listed under SC0423 Fringe Rate Expense  because S+F have no Object Class and re-calculated so that fringe is also applied to various leave types; current fringe charge is only $704.76
	* $3.07 (Victoria Burton - Fringe) not listed under SC0423 Fringe Rate Expense because S+F have no Object Class
	* IDC is incorrect, after all corrections and PAAs should be a total of $3,432.82~~

* PAAs needed of August:
	~~John Wilson Salary -- $2,116.63 on GR007979 NHAP MS/AL~~
	~~Malcolm Williamson Salary -- $1,201.25 on GR007979 NHAP MS/AL~~
	

### September
* PAAs needed for September:
	~~* John Wilson Salary -- $1,999.00 on GR007979 NHAP MS/AL~~


There are two additional tasks that I will need help with to wrap this one up:  

-   We will need a manual journal to correct the fringe calculation for John Wilson's career service award ($64.81)

-   The F&A charges are still lagging by more than just the difference in John's career service. My calculations show an F&A total of $41,124.82 @Kim Gillow had mentioned (maybe - I might have this wrong) there is an additional process and approvals that must be complete for the F&A to update? Does that sound like something that might be interfering?

This should balance the account.


## GR003636 // SPARC (prev)

Ended: August 31, 2020

Current issues preventing closing:

### July
* Charges mis-categorized due to missing Object Class:
	* $544.00 (Carla Klehm - Salary) not listed under SC0193 Extra Help
	* $31.77 (Carla Klehm - Fringe) not listed under SC0423 Fringe Rate Expense
	* 
	* Somehow the F&A has remained correct for these charges that have a (Blank) object class
	* 
### August
* Charges are correct

~~The invoice from the University of Glasgow, in the amount of $14,918.88, **needs to be paid **. It goes with the orphaned worktag GR012840, which should be an award line on award 1822110 and is associated with worktag GR003636 (an NSF award that started on 09/01/2018).~~

Since the subaward is $489.12 less than what was budgeted we **will not** do a PAA to address the current overage of $51.64 (would have been a PAA  for $32.74 salary   FROM: GR003636;   TO: DS01453).

I would like to charge a pro-portion of the SPARC MicroCT bill to SPARC (total: $1,500.00)
which means we want to:
debit $1,171.74 from DS01453; credit to GR003590
debit $328.26 from GR003636; credit to GR003590

This should balance the account.

Ends: December 31, 2020

Current issues:

### July
* Fringes mis-calculated:
	~~~~* An additional $91.30 should be charged to fringes (Seth Warn)~~
	~~* An additional $45.64 should be charged to IDC; Trickle down impact to IDC from fringe (Seth Warn)~~~~
### August
* PAAs needed:
	~~* Seth Warn Salary - $1,080.08 to GR013045 Sandia (from GR007994)~~
	~~* Jackson Cothren Salary - $2,899.36 to GR013045 Sandia (from PG002926)~~
### September
* PAAs needed:
	~~* Chris Angel Salary - $3,258.33 to GR008003 NIJ Fed Terrorism (from GR013045 Sandia)~~

**For GR013045,** this is the one that we need to get it correct so that we only have to make corrections (if needed) to December so that we can bill the sponsor by the end of December.  

-   Chris Angel PAA - move charges off of GR013045 to GR007995 for November; **PAA is waiting on Michelle Musial**  
    
-   Hank Theiss - charge holiday pto to GR013045 for November; **PAA is waiting on Josh Gilgen**  
    
-   will check expenses again after this PAA finishes approvals.
