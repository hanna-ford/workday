Ended: July 31, 2020

Current issues preventing closing:

~~Short $515.97 in Fringes:~~ 
~~Fringe benefits for July 2020 are incorrect. They need to be re-calculated so that fringe is also applied to various leave types~~
~~Short $6.04 in IDC: Trickle down effect of fringes being incorrect~~

~~Once these issues are resolved the total spend for July 2020 should be $37,535.74 AND the LTD total will be at $212,098.66 (which matches our records)~~

ORNL issues have been largely resolved. PAAs are in progress to move July 2020 expenses over to the new worktag.


## GR007979 // NHAP MS/ AL

Ended: September 30, 2020

Current issues preventing closing:

### July
~~Charges mis-categorized due to missing Object Class:~~
	 ~~$592.50 (Victoria Burton - Salary) not listed under SC0193 Extra Help~~
	 ~~$34.60 (Victoria Burton - Fringe) not listed under SC0423 Fringe Rate Expense~~
	 ~~$307.28 (Victoria Burton - IDC) not calculated because S+F have no Object Class~~

### August
~~Charges mis-categorized due to missing Object Class:~~
	~~$4,291.67 (Vance Green - Salary) not listed under SC0192 Regular Salaries because S+F have no Object Class~~
	~~$52.50 (Victoria Burton - Extra Help Wages) not listed under SC0193 Extra Help because S+F have no Object Class~~
	~~$1,138.58 (Vance Green - Fringe) not listed under SC0423 Fringe Rate Expense  because S+F have no Object Class and re-calculated so that fringe is also applied to various leave types; current fringe charge is only $704.76~~
	~~$3.07 (Victoria Burton - Fringe) not listed under SC0423 Fringe Rate Expense because S+F have no Object Class~~
	~~IDC is incorrect, after all corrections and PAAs should be a total of $3,432.82~~

~~PAAs needed of August:~~
	~~John Wilson Salary -- $2,116.63 on GR007979 NHAP MS/AL~~
	~~Malcolm Williamson Salary -- $1,201.25 on GR007979 NHAP MS/AL~~
	

### September
* PAAs needed for September:
	~~John Wilson Salary -- $1,999.00 on GR007979 NHAP MS/AL~~
	*Malcolm Williamson -- $25.42 from GR013387 to GR007979; submitted 12/18/2020


There are two additional tasks that I will need help with to wrap this one up:  

-   We will need a manual journal to correct the fringe calculation for John Wilson's career service award ($64.81)

-   The F&A charges are still lagging by more than just the difference in John's career service. My calculations show an F&A total of $41,124.82 @Kim Gillow had mentioned (maybe - I might have this wrong) there is an additional process and approvals that must be complete for the F&A to update? Does that sound like something that might be interfering?

This should balance the account.


## GR003636 // SPARC (prev)

Ended: August 31, 2020

Current issues preventing closing:

### July
* Charges mis-categorized due to missing Object Class:
	* $544.00 (Carla Klehm - Salary) not listed under SC0193 Extra Help
	* $31.77 (Carla Klehm - Fringe) not listed under SC0423 Fringe Rate Expense
	* 
	* Somehow the F&A has remained correct for these charges that have a (Blank) object class
	* 
### August
* Charges are correct

~~The invoice from the University of Glasgow, in the amount of $14,918.88, **needs to be paid **. It goes with the orphaned worktag GR012840, which should be an award line on award 1822110 and is associated with worktag GR003636 (an NSF award that started on 09/01/2018).~~

Since the subaward is $489.12 less than what was budgeted we **will not** do a PAA to address the current overage of $51.64 (would have been a PAA  for $32.74 salary   FROM: GR003636;   TO: DS01453).

I would like to charge a pro-portion of the SPARC MicroCT bill to SPARC (total: $1,500.00)
which means we want to:
debit $1,171.74 from DS01453; credit to GR003590
debit $328.26 from GR003636; credit to GR003590

This should balance the account.

Ends: December 31, 2020

Current issues:

### July
* Fringes mis-calculated:
	~~~~* An additional $91.30 should be charged to fringes (Seth Warn)~~
	~~* An additional $45.64 should be charged to IDC; Trickle down impact to IDC from fringe (Seth Warn)~~~~
### August
* PAAs needed:
	~~* Seth Warn Salary - $1,080.08 to GR013045 Sandia (from GR007994)~~
	~~* Jackson Cothren Salary - $2,899.36 to GR013045 Sandia (from PG002926)~~
### September
* PAAs needed:
	~~* Chris Angel Salary - $3,258.33 to GR008003 NIJ Fed Terrorism (from GR013045 Sandia)~~

**For GR013045,** this is the one that we need to get it correct so that we only have to make corrections (if needed) to December so that we can bill the sponsor by the end of December.  

-   Chris Angel PAA - move charges off of GR013045 to GR007995 for November; **PAA is waiting on Michelle Musial**  
    
-   Hank Theiss - charge holiday pto to GR013045 for November; **PAA is waiting on Josh Gilgen**  
    
-   will check expenses again after this PAA finishes approvals.

## GR003590 MRI Program Revenue

Ends: August 31, 2021


Workday things:

-   If you run the RPT - Department Grant Budget vs Actual for GR003590 (MRI Program Revenue) it shows that there is a balance of $21,895.61 in the account. THIS IS INCORRECT.
-   The ACTUAL BALANCE in the account is $17,395.61 and of that $8,522.39 are unspent pre-pay - so technically the available funds are $8,873.22 with the additional funds coming available as the pre-paid amount is drawn down.  
    
-   Please note that going forward we CANNOT receive cash payments under any circumstances.

I can go into great detail about what happened (it all starts in Feb 2019 with the first payment ðŸ˜¬), but that should probably be reserved for a show-and-tell phone call. I spent most of Monday and Tuesday trying to un-ravel this: including 2 hours on the phone with Kim Gillow explaining it to her and trying to figure out what we can do to balance this account. We had a call with OSP this morning and we have the first several steps toward balancing the account mapped out.

The to-do list:

-- I am going to work with OSP to document and correct $2000 in double-counted revenue.
 
-- For internal invoices, I have already sent that information to Kim G. and she is going to process the manual journals needed to debit those funds from internal customers.
 
-- For the cash payment of $30 from David Desrochers:
 -   We will need a W9 from him so we can establish him as a customer in WD;
-   Then we have to create a customer invoice;
-   Then one of us has to write a check for $30.00 in exchange for the $30.00 cash;
-   Then we can deposit the payment to the customer invoice.
 
-- For RA10178034, we are waiting on the Treasurer's office to let us know if they have received and deposited the check sent by OKState to determine if we need to have them cancel the check and re-issue for $500 OR if we will have to refund them $2000.  

@Manon Wilson: If you could please send me the contact information for David Desrochers (email and phone number) then I will ask Devanee to help us track down and get a W9 from him.

I also need you to look at the following line items and verify their accuracy and send copies of their MICRO statements:

-   RA10186150 Shanon Rusk Dooley/Eric McElroy $1000 goes with MICRO Statement 43
-   RA10186873 College of Charleston (Eric McElroy and Shannon Dool) $1000 and has no MICRO Statement associated
-   No U of A Invoice Sam Stephens/Jexpert $180 and has no MICRO Statement associated
