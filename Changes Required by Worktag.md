Ended: July 31, 2020

Current issues preventing closing:

* Short $515.97 in Fringes: 
Fringe benefits for July 2020 are incorrect. They need to be re-calculated so that fringe is also applied to various leave types.

* Short $6.04 in IDC: Trickle down effect of fringes being incorrect

Once these issues are resolved the total spend for July 2020 should be $37,535.74 AND the LTD total will be at $212,098.66 (which matches our records)

Current issues reenting cloing

### July
* Charges mis-categorized due to missing Object Class:
	* $544.00 (Carla Klehm - Salary) not listed under SC0193 Extra Help
	* $31.77 (Carla Klehm - Fringe) not listed under SC0423 Fringe Rate Expense

### August
* Charges are correct

The invoice from the University of Glasgow, in the amount of $14,918.88, **needs to be paid **. It goes with the orphaned worktag GR012840, which should be an award line on award 1822110 and is associated with worktag GR003636 (an NSF award that started on 09/01/2018).

Since the subaward is $489.12 less than what was budgeted we **will not** do a PAA to address the current overage of $51.64 (would have been a PAA  for $32.74 salary   FROM: GR003636;   TO: DS01453).

I would like to charge a pro-portion of the SPARC MicroCT bill to SPARC (total: $1,500.00)
which means we want to:
debit $1,171.74 from DS01453; credit to GR003590
debit $328.26 from GR003636; credit to GR003590

This should balance the account.
